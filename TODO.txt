Ideas / TODO

The most pressing issues can be found in the issue tracker on Github.

* daemon (nameserver) should be able to disconnect clients that haven't been active over the past X seconds
* HMAC: Allow per-proxy HMAC key (to be able to connect to different servers with different keys) -- but perhaps remove HMAC completely once the connection validator logic has been reimplemented
* let async/Future use a client-side threadpool instead of spawning endless new threads
* automatic callback handling if you pass a callable to the server
* Make Pyro support listening to multiple network interfaces at the same time (and returning the correct URI from the daemon. Name server is harder...)
* docs: explain callbacks better
* docs: how to use the socketserver API to write your own implementation
* add multiprocess server (forking?) based on multiprocessing?
* simplify the shutdown/close methods so that they only signal a shutdown condition and let the eventloop thread clean up nicely. This to avoid all kinds of exceptions on shutdown (mainly socketserver on ironpython now)
* object activation / object registration strategies: instance_per_call, instance_per_connection, shared_instance (let the daemon instantiate your object's class instead of user code)
* persistent Name Server (store namespace in a database on disk) use sqlite because it needs multithreading/transactions
* Pyro-over-SSH (not SSL) using Paramiko
